# Universe Test

## ðŸ§© Overview

This repository implements a scalable and maintainable event processing pipeline that integrates with NATS JetStream, processes social media events, and exposes analytics and reporting via API.

The system simulates event ingestion via a prebuilt `publisher` Docker image and provides a full-stack backend solution using NestJS, PostgreSQL, Prisma, and Prometheus/Grafana for observability.
